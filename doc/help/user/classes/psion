Psions are those gifted with psionic powers. Many people are born with latent psionic powers and may experience things such as deja vu, but only the psion can tap into these powers and develop them to their fullest. Psions are highly intelligent people and run the gamut of alignments, from kind-hearted sorts who wish to help those less fortunate to cunning types who wish to bend others to their wills.

A psion's path in life is determined through his discipline. It defines a selection of bonus spells and additional class skills the psion learns:
 %^CYAN%^Egoist: %^RESET%^athletics, perception
 %^CYAN%^Kineticist: %^RESET%^dungeoneering, influence
 %^CYAN%^Nomad: %^RESET%^endurance, survival
 %^CYAN%^Seer: %^RESET%^influence, perception
 %^CYAN%^Shaper: %^RESET%^influence, endurance
 %^CYAN%^Telepath: %^RESET%^influence, perception

Psions learn their powers with the %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command. When they %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ a power, they expend power points that they prepared using the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command. To see how many power points you have prepared use %^ORANGE%^<recall psion spells>%^RESET%^. The amount of power points a psion expends depends on the spell power.

Psions are essentially a pure caster class, although some of them learn to substitute their martial weakness with potent self-altering powers. Their spell-casting abilities depend on their intelligence score.

Psions can't cast in any armor or while wielding, but they can learn to do it.

Psions use intelligence, rather than wisdom, for their will saving throws.

Psions also make use of the Focus mechanic. While focused, the psion gets minor buffs, and the focus can be expended to perform certain feats and abilities.

While the psion is focused, they gain +1 to caster level.
